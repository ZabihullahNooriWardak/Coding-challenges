/* 
In other words, two strings are considered anagrams
 if they have the same characters with the same frequency,
  but the order of the characters is different. For example,
   “listen” and “silent” are anagrams because you can rearrange the letters in one to form the other.
*/


// my Algorithm steps 

// first we can check the length of both string 
// we should check sigle character of a string that is it in another string  and number of occurence
// and then check the number of occurence
